# Capstone Project under work

This is my final project for cs50w. This is an income expense tracker.

### Technologies used:

- Django for Backend
- HTML,CSS and JavaScript for front end
- Chart.js JavaScript library for creating and animating the charts
- sqlite3 for handling the database

### What this website does

- User can create acccount and log in
- User can add new transactions and select the type of the transaction as well.
- User can view all his transactions in one place in reverse chronological order
- User can view a graphical representation of all incomes and expenses and quickly check these values by just hovering over the chart

### About Chart.js

Chart.js is a javascript library that allows devs to create beatiful and high quality graphs. It also has a lot of clean animations built in. There are multiple options that can be changed to change the look and feel of the graphs.

This project is more complex than others in this series as it uses a javascript library and full website responsiveness. Making the charts responsive was a big task. Navbar items also arrange themselves as per the viewport
